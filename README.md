# Fire at the Fringe

We are a [SESYNC Graduate Pursuit](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/grad-themes-2014) team building a coupled model of fire, vegetation, and behavior dynamics in the San Diego wildland-urban interface. This repository primarily holds the statistical model that informs agent behavior in the model. There is also a demonstration coupled fire/agent-based model developed in NetLogo and the results of some structural equation modeling. 

@mvsana is leading the development of the fire simulation model, which is in [this repository](https://github.com/mvsaha/fire_sim).
