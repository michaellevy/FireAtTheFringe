ANALYSIS:
	ESTIMATOR IS MLR; ! For continuous items whose residuals may not be normal

MODEL:

! Measurement Models

	belief BY belief1-belief4;
	!experien BY exp2 exp3;	! drop exp1 (injured) because only 2% yes
	effect BY effect4-effect7;
	risk BY risk1-risk3;
	!current BY dsnow1-dsnow7;
	future BY dsfut4-dsfut7;
	
OUTPUT: 	
	!SAMPSTAT;	! Descriptive stats for variables
	!RESIDUAL;	! Requests standardized and normalized residuals
	STDYX;		! Requests fully standardized solution
	MODINDICES (ALL);	! Method to improve model (at p<.05)
